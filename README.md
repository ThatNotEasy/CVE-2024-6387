# OpenSSH CVE Scanner

The OpenSSH CVE Scanner is a Python script designed to scan multiple SSH targets for vulnerabilities based on their OpenSSH version. It utilizes threading for concurrent scanning and integrates logging with colored output for enhanced visibility.

## Features

- **Multi-threaded Scanning:** Utilizes threading to concurrently scan multiple targets, improving efficiency.
- **CVE Vulnerability Detection:** Checks SSH versions against a predefined list of CVE vulnerabilities to determine if a version is vulnerable.
- **Logging and Output:** Logs scan results to a file (`scan.log`) and optionally saves vulnerable targets to an output file.
- **Color-coded Output:** Uses Colorama and Coloredlogs to provide color-coded terminal output for clear status indication.
- **Interrupt Handling:** Supports Ctrl+C to gracefully terminate the script while ensuring ongoing threads complete their tasks.

## Usage

1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure Python dependencies (`coloredlogs`, `packaging`) are installed (`pip install coloredlogs packaging`).

2. **Running the Scanner:**
   - Provide a file (`-f`) containing a list of targets in the format `ip:port`.
   - Optionally specify an output file (`-o`) to save vulnerable targets.
   - Adjust the number of threads (`-t`) based on system resources or scanning requirements.

3. **Example Command:**
   ```bash
   python open_ssh_scanner.py -f targets.txt -o vulnerable_ips.txt -t 5
